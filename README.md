# Hi, I'm Mana Misumi, Junior Web DeveloperğŸŒ±

<h3>ğŸŒ¼A Little About MyselfğŸŒ¼</h3>
<p>My background lies in hotel and tourism management, but I have decided to pursue a career change into web development. This decision is driven by my deep fascination with the digital world â€“ particularly how websites and applications are designed and function.
The ever-evolving nature of technology, its capacity to connect people, and the creative possibilities it offers in crafting user experiences resonate strongly with me.</p>
